# tkintertest
This is a chat application made by [Dexrey4](https://github.com/dexrey4) and [enbyte](https://github.com/enbyte). To use this, run the server on a device that allows connections through a certain port. Then type that port number into the terminal/cmd when it asks what port to host on. Then find the ip of that device (type "ipconfig getifaddr en1" on mac and "ipconfig", then look for the Ipv4 adress on windows) and send it to whomever is using the program. They then type in that IP and the port (that the server is hosted on) when prompted. Then they type their name and they should connect. server.py is the server and tkinter-chat.py is the client. Hope you enjoy :)
